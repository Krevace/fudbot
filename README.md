# Fudb√∂t

What was originally conceived as an ambitious cross-campus food delivery bot was ultimately reduced to a line following robot by my Foundations of Engineering professor. Was still fun to make though, and in hindsight, this simple project was a blessing for my free time. The CAD model below is by my group member, Ty Stephens.
